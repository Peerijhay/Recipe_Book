  <h1>Why You Shouldn't Add Butter to Eggs</h1>

  <p>There are a few reasons why you shouldn't add butter to eggs:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>It can make eggs rubbery.</li>
    <li>It can add unnecessary calories and fat.</li>
    <li>It can raise your cholesterol levels.</li>
    <li>It can burn easily.</li>
    <li>It can stick to the pan.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you're looking for a way to make your eggs more flavorful and creamy, there are a few other options that are healthier than butter. You can try using olive oil, avocado oil, or coconut oil. You can also add herbs and spices to your eggs for flavor.</p>
