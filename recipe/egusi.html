  <h1>How to Prepare Egusi Soup</h1>

  <p>Egusi soup is a popular Nigerian soup made with melon seeds, leafy greens, and protein. It is a hearty and flavorful soup that is perfect for a cold day.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>2 cups ground egusi seeds</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped haba単ero pepper (optional)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup palm oil</li>
    <li>1/2 cup beef broth</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
    <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground crayfish</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>2 cups chopped leafy greens, such as spinach or bitter leaf</li>
    <li>1 pound cooked meat or fish, such as beef, chicken, or shrimp (optional)
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, soak the egusi seeds in water for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>While the egusi seeds are soaking, heat the palm oil in a large pot over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Add the onion, bell pepper, and haba単ero pepper (if using) to the pot and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Drain the egusi seeds and add them to the pot. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
    <li>Add the beef broth, chicken broth, diced tomatoes, crayfish, salt, and black pepper to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the egusi seeds have softened.</li>
    <li>Stir in the leafy greens and cooked meat or fish (if using) and cook until the greens are wilted, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately with rice or your favorite side dish.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Tips</h2>

  * For a thicker soup, you can mash some of the egusi seeds in a mortar and pestle before adding them to the pot.
* If you don't have haba単ero peppers, you can use another type of chili pepper, such as jalape単o or cayenne peppers.
* You can add other vegetables to the soup, such as carrots, celery, or potatoes.
* To make a vegetarian version of the soup, omit the meat or fish and add an extra cup of leafy greens.

  <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
