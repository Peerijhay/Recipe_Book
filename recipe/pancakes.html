<h1>How to Make Pancakes</h1>

<p>Pancakes are a classic breakfast food that is easy to make and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. They are also a versatile food that can be topped with a variety of different ingredients, such as syrup, fruit, and nuts.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 egg
* 1 cup milk
* 2 tablespoons melted butter

<h2>Instructions</h2>

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, and melted butter.
3. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and whisk until just combined. Do not overmix, as this will make the pancakes tough.
4. Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. Grease the skillet or griddle with butter or cooking spray.
5. Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet or griddle for each pancake. Cook for 1-2 minutes per side, or until golden brown.
6. Serve the pancakes immediately with your favorite toppings.

<h2>Tips</h2>

* For fluffier pancakes, let the batter rest for 5-10 minutes before cooking.
* Do not overcrowd the skillet or griddle when cooking the pancakes.
* If the pancakes are sticking to the skillet or griddle, add a little more butter or cooking spray.
* Serve the pancakes immediately for the best flavor and texture.

<h2>Enjoy!</h2>
