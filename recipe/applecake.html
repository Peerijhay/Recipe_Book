  <h1>How to Bake an Apple Cake</h1>

  <p>Apple cake is a delicious and easy-to-make dessert that is perfect for any occasion. It is also a great way to use up leftover apples.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups sugar</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>3 cups peeled, cored, and sliced apples</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking pan.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
    <li>Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
    <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
    <li>Fold in the apples and walnuts (if using).</li>
    <li>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan.</li>
    <li>Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.</li>
    <li>Let the cake cool completely before serving.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Tips</h2>

  * For a more flavorful cake, use a variety of apples, such as Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, and Fuji.
* To prevent the apples from sinking to the bottom of the cake, toss them in a tablespoon of flour before adding them to the batter.
* For a richer flavor, add a teaspoon of cinnamon or nutmeg to the batter.
* To make a glaze for the cake, combine 1 cup of powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons of milk, and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract in a small bowl. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled cake.

  <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
